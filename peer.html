                    <!-- Explanation of peer workshops -->
                    <p>Peer connection workshops for retiring collegiate athletes offer a powerful platform for athletes to bond over their shared experiences of transitioning from competitive sports. These workshops create a safe, supportive environment where athletes can openly discuss the challenges they face as they move away from their athletic careers. The peer-to-peer dynamic encourages athletes to connect with others who truly understand the emotional and mental hurdles involved in retirement, including identity loss, the struggle to find purpose, and the adjustment to a life outside of organized sports.
                    
                    <p>In these workshops, participants engage in group discussions, activities, and guided exercises designed to foster empathy and support. The shared experience of retiring from college sports can be isolating, but these workshops help athletes realize that they are not alone in their feelings. Through discussions about navigating the post-athletic phase, athletes can exchange coping strategies, gain insights into how others have managed similar transitions, and form lasting connections that can serve as a support network beyond the workshop.</p>
                    
                    <p>The benefit of these peer connection workshops lies in the power of community and shared understanding. Retiring athletes often face unique challenges that those outside the athletic world might not fully comprehend. By creating a space where athletes can openly discuss their emotions, struggles, and future aspirations, these workshops facilitate healing and empowerment. Athletes leave these sessions not only with a deeper understanding of their own transition but also with new friendships and resources to help them thrive in their next chapter.</p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, development of our app, Reathlete, is underway! This app will inform users of peer workshops in the area, as well as facilitate virtual conversations between athletes across the country!</p>
