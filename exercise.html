                <aside>
                    <h6>Video 1: Jogging</h6>
                    <p>Jogging is a highly beneficial exercise for retired collegiate athletes as it helps maintain cardiovascular health, improve endurance, and support mental well-being. Regular jogging can ease the transition from intense athletic training to a more sustainable fitness routine, reducing the risk of heart disease and maintaining healthy body weight. It also promotes the release of endorphins, boosting mood and alleviating stress, which is crucial during the often challenging post-sports adjustment period. Additionally, jogging is accessible and requires minimal equipment, making it a practical choice for staying active after retirement from competitive sports.</p>
                    <h6>Video 2: Jumping Roping</h6>
                    <p>
                    Jumping rope is an excellent exercise for retired collegiate athletes, offering a full-body workout that improves cardiovascular health, coordination, and agility. It strengthens key muscle groups, including the legs, core, and shoulders, while enhancing balance and endurance. This high-intensity, low-impact activity can be adjusted to various fitness levels, making it ideal for maintaining athletic performance after retirement. Additionally, jumping rope is portable and requires minimal space and equipment, making it a convenient option for staying active and supporting long-term physical and mental health. You can incorporate tricks into standard jumping patterns as well. 
                    </p>
                    <h6>Video 3: Core Strengthing</h6>
                    <p>
                    Core strengthening on a yoga mat is highly beneficial for retired collegiate athletes, as it supports overall stability, balance, and injury prevention. Core-focused exercises enhance posture, reduce lower back pain, and improve athletic performance in daily activities. Training on a yoga mat adds comfort and reduces joint strain, making it suitable for various fitness levels. Incorporating core routines into a post-athletic lifestyle promotes long-term physical health, helping athletes stay active and resilient well beyond their competitive years. Adding light weights to exercises such as Deadbugs and Russian Twists will increase the intensity, as will slowing down the tempo and focusing strictly on form. 
                    </p>
                    <h6>Video 4: Swimming</h6>
                    <p>
                    Swimming is an excellent low-impact exercise for retired collegiate athletes, offering a full-body workout while reducing stress on joints. It improves cardiovascular endurance, muscle strength, and flexibility, making it ideal for maintaining overall fitness. The buoyancy of water supports the body, minimizing the risk of injury while enhancing recovery from past sports-related strains. Swimming also promotes mental well-being by reducing stress and fostering relaxation, helping athletes transition to a healthy, active post-competition lifestyle.
